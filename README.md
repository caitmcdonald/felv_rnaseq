# Overview

This repo will include code, data, and results related to RNAsequencing
of fibroblasts and PMBCs infected with FeLV. Following work by Chiu et
al.Â (insert hyperlink here), endogenous FeLV can potentially decrease
the effects of exogenous FeLV infection in domestic cats. The goal of
this RNAseq project is to identify whether enFeLV LTR insertion site
significantly alters transcription of anti-exFeLV genes.
