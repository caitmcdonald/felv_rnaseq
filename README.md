# Overview

This repo will include code, data, and results related to RNAsequencing of fibroblasts and PMBCs infected with FeLV. Following work by Chiu et al. (insert hyperlink here), endogenous FeLV can potentially decrease the effects of exogenous FeLV infection in domestic cats. The goal of this RNAseq project is to identify whether enFeLV LTR insertion site significantly alters transcription of anti-exFeLV genes.
