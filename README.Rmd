# Overview

## Project goal
Following work by [Chiu et al. 2020](https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/JVI.01274-20), endogenous FeLV can potentially decrease the effects of exogenous FeLV infection in domestic cats. The goal of this project is to identify whether enFeLV LTR integration site significantly alters transcription of host genes.

## Contents
This repo will include code, data, and results related to RNA-sequencing of fibroblasts and PMBCs from domestic cats and one puma. PMBCs were never infected with FeLV, so are included for baseline data. Fibroblast samples are matched and include infected and uninfected samples. Detailed sample information can be found in [RNAseq data summary](001_rnaseq_data_summary.md).
